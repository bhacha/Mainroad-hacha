# Mainroad

**Mainroad** is a responsive, simple, clean and content-focused [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme based on the
[MH Magazine lite](https://wordpress.org/themes/mh-magazine-lite/) theme.

**This version** is an edit of the Vimux Mainroad, with some slight changes to implement new features. As of 11/30/23, this is only a new "Affiliations" side-menu.
